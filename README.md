# Master-Thesis-Project
The final paper is performed as a project for one of the biggest mining companies in Austria.
### Description of the project
Detailed information about movements, timestamps, statuses and other conditions of a dump truck is generated every 2 seconds and by the end of each day formed into a csv file on a central computer.
The main task is the optimization of a traffic flow control of vehicles in the mine. A solution on how to improve current truck dispatch system has to be developed.
### Solution
The current dispatch system in the mine was improved by a special Python script. This script works on a data analysis. 
Principle of operation:
* The script is located in a folder on a computer
* A csv file with raw dataset has to be placed into that folder
* Script starts to work by double clicking on it
* After 10-15 seconds in the same folder there will appear 4 png documents with plots and graphs and 1 txt file with idling report
